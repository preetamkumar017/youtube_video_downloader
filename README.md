Use yt-dlp (More Reliable)
If the issue persists, consider switching to the more robust yt-dlp library.

Install yt-dlp:
pip install yt-dlp

yt-dlp -o "%(playlist_title)s/%(title)s.%(ext)s" https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=YOUR_PLAYLIST_ID


This tool is more resilient to YouTube changes and often bypasses errors like 403.

If you want to download a single video using yt-dlp, you can use the following command:

Command:
yt-dlp -o "%(title)s.%(ext)s" VIDEO_URL

Example:
yt-dlp -o "%(title)s.%(ext)s" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID

This will:

Download the video in the best available quality.
Save it with its title as the filename in the current directory.
Additional Options:
Choose Specific Quality: If you want to select a specific resolution or format:
yt-dlp -f "bestvideo[height<=1080]+bestaudio/best" -o "%(title)s.%(ext)s" VIDEO_URL

This ensures you download a video up to 1080p with audio.

Audio-Only: If you only want the audio:
yt-dlp -f "bestaudio" --extract-audio --audio-format mp3 -o "%(title)s.%(ext)s" VIDEO_URL

Download to a Specific Directory:
yt-dlp -o "/path/to/directory/%(title)s.%(ext)s" VIDEO_URL
